# Custom PC Hardware Monitoring Tool

## Current Completed Version
The current completed version is a simple command line program that works on Windows. It prints the available storage drives on your system, how much space is available for each, the percent of RAM currently being utilized, and the percentage of CPU currently being utilized. I have an AMD GPU in my system so at this time I am unable to get any information on the GPU status on Windows. I also haven't found a way to access hardware temperatures on Windows that doesn't involve downloading third-party software, so that is not incorporated into this verison.

## Future Improvements 
There are a number of drawbacks to the current version that I would like to iterate on and improve. The following are just a few:

* Create a GUI to display the information, rather than having it printed in the console.
* Make the program compatible with other OS's.
* Incorporate hardware temperatures
* Incorporate GPU information
