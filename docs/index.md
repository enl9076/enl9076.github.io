# Welcome to my portfolio

I am a Social Psychologist with an enthusiasm for data science and programming.

## Projects Overview
My portfolio is divided into four sections:

* **Current projects** - projects (any language or framework) that I am currently working on or actively planning
* **Previous data science projects** - projects I have completed that involve machine learning or handling a large amount of data; will typically be in R or Python
* **Previous Python projects** - exactly what it says; projects I have completed that were written in Python but were not data science related
* **Previous Arduino projects** - projects I have completed that have a hardware component; will have an associated document explaining the hardware components used and why; typically written in C++ using the Arduino IDE but occasionally will be written in Python/CircuitPython
